# Natours - Advanced CSS and SASS Course on Udemy - Project 1

For this website I used modern CSS technologies.
I used the SASS preprocessor, to write cleaner and performant code.
This is Jona's design, you cand find the course where he implements this project step by step here: https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-css-and-sass/

In the future I'll try to add more functionalities, to make a better user experience!

I added some features that are not in the course, and you can see them in the app.js file
